# Laravel Docs Dark Mode
>A stylus theme for the laravel docs

## Why
I don't know, I like dark modes. I was going to put in a PR but two previous attempts have been denied, so I didn't think my odds were good either. This should be just as good until an official dark mode get's sanctioned.

## Contributing
The default theme is set to be "laravel-ish" but if you'd like another to be available feel free to pr and I'll add it below as an option.

## Install

1. Make Sure you have Stylus/Stylish installed 

2. Click below to install, this will allow automatic updates or just open the file and copy and paste it
